# architectural patterns

Architectural patterns offer high-level strategies for organizing large-scale software systems. They define fundamental structures and relationships between components, addressing concerns like scalability, performance, and modularity.  Examples include layered architecture, MVC (Model-View-Controller), and microservices. Understanding architectural patterns helps you make informed decisions about the overall structure of your application.
