# P.O.O

Object-oriented programming (OOP) centers around the concept of "objects" that encapsulate data (attributes) and the code that manipulates it (methods). This organization promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier understanding of complex systems. OOP emphasizes breaking down problems into self-contained objects that interact with each other.
