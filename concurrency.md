Concurrency is crucial when studying design patterns because ignoring it can lead to subtle and devastating errors.  Without proper concurrency management, your applications may suffer from race conditions, deadlocks, or unpredictable performance.  Many design patterns inherently involve complex concurrency challenges; failing to address them will result in unreliable and potentially disastrous software.
