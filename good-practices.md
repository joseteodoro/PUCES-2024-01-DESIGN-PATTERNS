# good practices for coding

Good coding practices promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability â€“ principles that align perfectly with object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP provides structures (classes, inheritance) to implement these practices. Design patterns offer proven solutions to common problems, often within a concurrent context.  Understanding good practices alongside OOP and design patterns is essential for crafting robust, scalable, and efficient software.
